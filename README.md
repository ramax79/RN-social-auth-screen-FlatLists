In this tutorial I'm going to teach you how to synchronise two different FlatList and how to create a picker animation in React Native. This is a performant animation that will work on both iOS and Android at 60fps.
You can use this picker when doing a react native social auth screen.

- How to get the selected item from a FlatList using onMomentumScrollEnd event
- How to create this Masked effect using two different FlatLists
